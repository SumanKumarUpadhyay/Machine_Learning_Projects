# 🎯 **Fake News Prediction Model**  
Classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using machine learning.

---

## 📝 **Problem Statement**  
The spread of fake news has significant social and political implications. This project aims to classify news articles as **real** or **fake** using a **Logistic Regression Model**, achieving a test accuracy of **97.9%**.

## 📂 **Dataset**  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data)  
- **Description**:  
  - **Features**:  
    - `Title`: The headline of the news article.  
    - `Text`: The main content of the news article.  
    - `Author`: The author of the news article.  
  - **Target**: `Label`  
    - `1`: Fake News  
    - `0`: Real News

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation  
  - `numpy` - Numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` - Data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning implementation  
  - `nltk` - Natural language processing

## 🔍 **Project Workflow**  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Load the dataset and inspect its structure.  
   - Handle missing values by imputing or dropping them.  
   - Clean the text data (remove stopwords, punctuation, and perform stemming).  
   - Convert text into numerical format using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Analyze the distribution of labels (`real` vs. `fake`).  
   - Visualize common words in fake and real news articles using word clouds.  

3. **Model Building**:  
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.  
   - Train a **Logistic Regression Model** on the training data.  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.  

4. **Prediction**:  
   - Test the model with unseen data.  
   - Predict whether a news article is real or fake.
